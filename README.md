General Information
===================
This is a prototype of a deduplication system, named destor.

Features
========
1. Container-based storage;
2. Chunk-level pipeline;
3. Fixed-sized chunking and Content-Defined Chunking (CDC);
4. A variety of fingerprint indexes, including DDFS, Extreme Binning, Sparse Index, SiLo, etc.
5. A variety of rewriting algorithms, including CFL, CBR, CAP, etc.
6. A variety of restore algorithms, including LRU, optimal replacement algorithm, rolling forward assembly.

Environment
===========
Linux 64bit.

Dependencies
============
1. libssl-dev is required to calculate sha-1 digest;
2. GLib 2.32 or later version; 
3. MySQL and libmysqlclient-dev is required;
4. Makefile is automatically generated by GNU autoconf and automake.

INSTALL
=======
If all dependencies are installed,
compiling destor is straightforward:

./configure
make
make install

To uninstall destor, run
make uninstall

Running
=======
If compile and install are successful, the executable file, destor, should have been moved to /usr/local/bin by default.
You can create a config file, destor.config, in where you run destor.
A sample destor.config is in scripts directory,
and many scripts for experiment are also there.
Run rebuild script to clean data.

destor has provided four types of services:
1. start a backup job,
    destor <directory or file>
2. start a recovery job,
    destor -r<jobid> <dest directory>
3. start a delete job,
    destor -d<jobid>
4. lookup statistics of system,
    destor -s
5. help
    destor -h
6. make a trace
    destor -t <path of raw files>

Configure
=========
A sample configuration is shown in destor.conf

Bugs
====
1. If the running destor is crashed artificially or unexpectedly, data consistency is not guaranted and you'd better run rebuild script.
2. Does NOT support concurrent backup/restore.
3. If working path in destor.config is modified, the rebuild script in scripts folder must be modified too.
